# LED-configuration-system

## Scope 
LEDs have a strict need for the right voltage and the right current. In order to accomplish that, the correct series resistor has to be selected by calculation.A set of different LEDs are taken, all working with a forward current of around 20mA. Our Arduino-based device should take on any LED and measure the operation point voltage. In the next steps, information about the LED, including recommendations for series resistors at different source voltages and other useful usage recommendations and values are displayed.
## Components Required
1. 1 Arduino Uno kit
2. 100,180,200 ohm resistor
3. 2 LEDs each (yellow, red, green)
4. 2 Potentiometer (500 ohms)
5. USB Cable
6. Display
7. Breadboard
8. Wires- male to female, Male to Male, female to female
